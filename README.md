TITANIC SURVIVAL PREDICTOR USING LOGISTIC REGRESSION ALGORITHM

The sinking of the Titanic is one of the most infamous shipwrecks in history.
On April 15, 1912, during her maiden voyage, the widely considered “unsinkable” RMS Titanic sank after colliding with an iceberg. Unfortunately, there weren’t enough lifeboats for everyone on board, resulting in the death of 1502 out of 2224 passengers and crew in the titanic.
While there was some element of luck involved in surviving, it seems some groups of people were more likely to survive than others.


About dataset: Contains passenger data
Columns:
PassengerId, Survived, Pclass, Name, Sex, Age, SibSp, Parch, Ticket, Fare, Cabin, Embarked.

In this project, ive done the basic data cleaning, preparation and transformation. 
Also, ive created various graphs and charts to study the parameters. 
Later, Ive used The Machine Learning model of Logistic Regression to predict the Survival chances of passengers based on their personal data using Exploratory data analytics.
